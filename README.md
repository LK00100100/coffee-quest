Tomb of the mask clone.

You must code and you need coffee. The coffee machine is broken so you must
wander the office and consume raw coffee beans for caffeine.

## Writing Code

`npm install` once.

Then use `npm run watch`

edit files in `src/`

## etc

`npm run build` - make prod build (minificiation, no source maps, etc).

`npm run dev` - build project, open server, don't watch for changes.
