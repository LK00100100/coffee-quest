# tomb-of-the-mask-clone

You are a coder in a Big City office.
You must code and you need coffee. The coffee machine is broken so you must
illegally wander the deep inner bowels of the office and find enough machine parts to repair the machine. You must dodge various dangers to achieve your mission.

## controls
- wsad - move (can't stop)
- space - eat pizza
- z,x - camera zoom

## game
- security guard - stops you
- rats - friendly; scares security.
- $15 Big City Personal Pizza - temporarily makes you immune to everything.

Inspired by "Tomb of the Mask"

## Writing Code

Then use `npm start` (will reload on changes)

## etc
